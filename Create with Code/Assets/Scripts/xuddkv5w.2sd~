        // will multiply with time now.
        // transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime*speed);

        // Pehle upar waale case mein  it moves forward without pressing any key
        // now we will work on a similar approach but use keys now
        transform.Translate(Vector3.forward * Time.deltaTime * speed * forwardInput);

        //We are adding some turn speed now so that vehicles can move left or right now
